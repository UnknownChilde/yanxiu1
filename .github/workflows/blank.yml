# events but only for the main branch

  #push:
  #  branches: [ main ]
  #pull_request:
  #  branches: [ main ]
  watch:
    types: started
  #schedule:
  #  - cron: 50 21 * * *

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
